# [Technology Stack for Web Application Development](https://rubygarage.org/blog/technology-stack-for-web-development) 

1. Picking the right **"Technology Stack"** one's app/web app will be based on.
   <br>
2. **Technology Development Stack** comprises of 2 sides of web development, the client side (FrontEnd) and the server-side (involves an application, a BackEnd programming language that powers it, database, and server itself)
   
   #### Client-side Programming
        * HTML - tells browser how to display
        * CSS - styles the content being displayed
        * JavaScript - makes pages interactive
          -> JavaScript Libraries
                * jQuery
                * React.js
                * Zepto.js
          -> Frameworks
                * Angular
                * VUE
                * Backbone
                * Ember

    #### Server-side Programming (not visible to user's)
        * Powers client-side
        * Challenge of choosing server-side Tech for web app/apps
        * Used to create the logic of websites and applications
        * Frameworks offers tools for simpler and faster coding
  
          -> Popular Programming Languages and Major Frameworks
                * Ruby (Ruby on Rails)
                * Python (Django, Flask, Pylons)
                * PHP (Laravel)
                * Java (Spring)
                * Scala (Play)
                * Node.js, JavaScript runtime, also used for backend programming

        * Database - stores web apps/apps data - 2 Types
            * Relational
            * Non-Relational
  
         -> Common databases for web development
            * MySQL (relational)
            * PostgreSQL (relational)
            * MongoDB (non-relational, document)
  
        * Web application needs a caching system to reduce the load on the 
          database and to handle large amounts of traffic

         -> Widespread caching systems
            * Memcached
            * Redis

        * Server - handles client's request via computer (Client's computer)
  
         -> Major players in this domain
            * Apache
            * Nginx

##### In short to develop web apps you must select a server, database, programming language, framework, and the frontend tools. These dev web tech build on top of each other and collectively are called a "Stack".
